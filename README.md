# RoleGameStoryGenerator

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

RoleGameStoryGenerator is a chatbot capable of developing stories or characters that can guide the writer to create campaigns and characters in different Role-playing games.


## Background

RoleGameStoryGenerator can provide ideas and write scenes, narratives or character sheets based on user requests. When creating scenes, it stores in its prompt the context to generate a fluid story that the writer can adapt to their campaigns.

The target of this project is to provide ideas, as well as dealing with "writer's block", for RPG storytellers who want to create their own campaigns or NPCs, as well as players who need ideas when creating their NP.


## How is it used?

RoleGameStoryGenerator works as a chatbot specialized in the narration of stories and characters from the most popular role-playing games. The user can guide the chatbot through questions and requests to develop its story and characters.

The model is trained for the most popular role-playing games on the market, but its API is provided to be trained with any role-playing game or any type of narrative setting, including those invented by the consumer.

## Challenges

As a chatbot capable of developing stories, the first challenge we face is having the necessary volume of training data for our model to be able to generate coherent and well-narrated stories.

Another challenge from a technical point of view is to guarantee the memory of our chatbot so that it is able to develop fluent stories based on the context of the current narration.

From an ethical point of view, the user could use this chatbot to generate commercial content by passing it off as self-created content.

## What next?

Different specialized models could be created for the type of narrative that the user wants to develop, and not just limited to role-playing games. The chatbot could be specialized to be a story generator, regardless of the genre and tone of the story, using a wide range of training models.
